-- MAGIC ## Wind Turbine Prescriptive Maintenance with the Databricks Intelligence Data Platform: Bringing Generative AI to Predictive Maintenance
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Being able to collect and centralize industrial equipment information in real time is critical in the energy space. When a wind turbine is down, it is not generating power which leads to poor customer service and lost revenue. Data is the key to unlock critical capabilities such as energy optimization, anomaly detection, and/or predictive maintenance. The rapid rise of Generative AI provides the opportunity to revolutionize maintenance by not only predicting when equipment is likely to fail, but also generating prescriptive maintenance actions to prevent failurs before they arise and optimize equipment performance. This enables a shift from predictive to prescriptive maintenance. <br/> 
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/Datastohne/demo/blob/main/Screenshot%202024-10-01%20at%2010.23.40.png?raw=true" width="700px" style="float:right; margin-left: 20px"/>
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Prescriptive maintenance examples include:
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC - Analyzing equipment IoT sensor data in real time
-- MAGIC - Predict mechanical failure in an energy pipeline
-- MAGIC - Diagnose root causes for predicted failure and generate prescriptive actions
-- MAGIC - Detect abnormal behavior in a production line
-- MAGIC - Optimize supply chain of parts and staging for scheduled maintenance and repairs
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ### What we'll build
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC In this demo, we'll build a end-to-end IoT platform, collecting data from multiple sources in real time. 
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Based on this information, we will build a predictive model that predicts wind turbine failure (predictive maintenance). Next, we will leverage this predictive model as AI tool in an AI system that will generate maintenance work orders (prescriptive maintenance), based on similar historical maintenance reports and turbine specifications. This way our maintenance teams can proactively address potential failures before they arise, to reduce downtime and increase Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE).
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC In addition, the business requested a dashboard that would allow their Turbine Maintenance group to monitor the turbines, identify the ones at risk of failure and browse through the generated maintenance work orders. This will also allow us to track our ROI and ensure we reach our productivity goals over the year.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC At a very high level, this is the flow we will implement:

-- MAGIC     <img src="https://github.com/Datastohne/demo/blob/main/Prescriptive%20Maintenance%20Demo%20Overview%20(26).png?raw=true" width="1000px">
-- MAGIC </div>
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC 1. Ingest and create our IoT database and tables which are easily queriable via SQL.
-- MAGIC 2. Secure data and grant read access to the Data Analyst and Data Science teams.
-- MAGIC 3. Run BI queries to analyze existing failures.
-- MAGIC 4. Build ML model to monitor our wind turbine farm & trigger predictive maintenance operations.
-- MAGIC 5. Generate maintenance work orders for field service engineers utilizing Generative AI.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Being able to predict which wind turbine will potentially fail is only the first step to increase our wind turbine farm efficiency. Once we're able to build a model predicting potential maintenance, we can dynamically adapt our spare part stock, generate work orders for field service engineers and even automatically dispatch maintenance team with the proper equipment.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC ### Our dataset
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC To simplify this demo, we'll consider that an external system is periodically sending data into our blob storage (S3/ADLS/GCS):
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC - Turbine data *(location, model, identifier etc)*
-- MAGIC - Wind turbine sensors, every sec *(energy produced, vibration, typically in streaming)*
-- MAGIC - Turbine status over time, labelled by our analyst team, and historical maintenance reports *(historical data to train on model on and to index into vector database)*
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC *Note that at a technical level, our data could come from any source. Databricks can ingest data from any system (SalesForce, Fivetran, queuing message like kafka, blob storage, SQL & NoSQL databases...).*
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Let's see how this data can be used within the Data Intelligence Platform to analyze sensor data,  trigger predictive maintenance and generate work orders.

-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC <br><br><br>
-- MAGIC Being able to run analysis on our historical data provided the team with a lot of insights to drive our business. We can now better understand the impact of downtime and see which turbines are currently down in our near real-time dashboard.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC However, knowing what turbines have failed isn't enough. We now need to take it to the next level and build a predictive model to detect potential failures before they happen and increase uptime and minimize costs.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC This is where the Lakehouse value comes in. Within the same platform, anyone can start building an ML model to predict the failures using traditional ML development or with our low code solution AutoML.

-- COMMAND ----------

-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC <br><br><br>
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC The rise of Generative AI enables a shift from Predictive to Prescriptive Maintenance ML Models. By going from ML models to agent systems, we can now leverage the predictive model as one of the many components of the AI system. This opens up a whole lot of new opportunities for automation and efficiency gains, which will further increase uptime and minimize costs.
-- MAGIC
-- MAGIC Databricks offers a a set of tools to help developers build, deploy and evaluate production-quality AI agents like Retrievel Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, including a vector database, model serving endpoints, governance, monitoring and evaluation capabilties. 
-- MAGIC
