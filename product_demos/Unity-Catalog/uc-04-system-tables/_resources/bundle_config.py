  "fullDescription": "Databricks Unity Catalog is the world's first AI-powered governance solution for the lakehouse. It empowers enterprises to seamlessly govern their structured and unstructured data, ML models, notebooks, dashboards, and files on any cloud or platform. <br/>Through Delta Sharing, Databricks Unity Catalog offers direct access to many of the lakehouse activity logs exposed in Delta as System Tables. System Tables are the cornerstone of lakehouse observability and enable at-scale operational intelligence on numerous key business questions. <br/>In this demo, we'll show how Unity Catalog System Tables can be used to: <ul><li>Monitor your consumption and leverage the lakehouse AI capabilities to forecast your future usage, triggering alerts when billing goes above your criterias</li><li>Monitor accesses to your data assets</li><li>Monitor and understand your platform usage</li></ul>",
