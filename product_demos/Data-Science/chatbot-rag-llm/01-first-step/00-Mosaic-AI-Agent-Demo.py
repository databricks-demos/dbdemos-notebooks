# MAGIC ## From data to chatbot in 10 minutes
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Rag applications are decoupled in 2 main parts:
# MAGIC - The knowledge database used to add additional context and improve the bot answer
# MAGIC - The actual chatbot application and its review / feedback mechanism
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 1.1/ Data preparation for RAG: building and indexing our knowledge base into Databricks Vector Search
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by prepraing our knowledge database. In this simple first demo, we'll be using data from Databricks Documentation already prepared and chuncked.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <!-- Collect usage data (view). Remove it to disable collection or disable tracker during installation. View README for more details.  -->

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Vector search endpoints are entities where your indexes will live. Think about them as entry point to handle your search request. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by creating our first Vector Search endpoint. Once created, you can view it in the [Vector Search Endpoints UI](#/setting/clusters/vector-search). Click on the endpoint name to see all indexes that are served by the endpoint.

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.vector_search.client import VectorSearchClient

# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 1.3/ Creating the Vector Search Index
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once the endpoint is created, all we now have to do is to as Databricks to create the index on top of the existing table. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You just need to specify the text column and our embedding foundation model (`GTE`).  Databricks will build and synchronize the index automatically for us.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This can be done using the API, or in a few clicks within the Unity Catalog Explorer menu:

# MAGIC
# MAGIC As any appliaction, a RAG chain needs some configuration for each environement (ex: different catalog for test/prod environement). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks makes this easy with Chain Configurations. You can use this object to configure any value within your app, including the different system prompts and make it easy to test and deploy newer version with better prompt.

# COMMAND ----------

# For this first basic demo, we'll keep the configuration as a minimum. In real app, you can make all your RAG as a param (such as your prompt template to easily test different prompts!)

# MAGIC # 3/ Use the Mosaic AI Quality Lab to evaluate your RAG applications
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## 3.1/ Chat with your bot and build your validation dataset!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our Chat Bot is now live. Databricks provides a built-in chatbot application that you can use to test the chatbot and give feedbacks on its answer.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can easily give access to external domain experts and have them test and review the bot.  **Your domain experts do NOT need to have Databricks Workspace access** - you can assign permissions to any user in your SSO if you have enabled [SCIM](https://docs.databricks.com/en/admin/users-groups/scim/index.html)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is a critical step to build or improve your evaluation dataset: have users ask questions to your bot, and provide the bot with output answer when they don't answer properly.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your Chatbot is automatically capturing all stakeholder questions and bot responses, including an MLflow trace for each, into Delta Tables in your Lakehouse. On top of that, Databricks makes it easy to track feedback from your end user: if the chatbot doesn't give a good answer and the user gives a thumbdown, their feedback is included in the Delta Tables.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once your eval dataset is ready, you'll then be able to leverage it for offline evaluation to measure your new chatbot performance, and also potentially to Fine Tune your model.

# MAGIC ## 3.2/ Evaluate your bot's quality with Mosaic AI Quality Lab specialized LLM judge models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our bot is now Live. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Evaluation is a key part of deploying a RAG application. Databricks simplify this tasks with specialized LLM models tuned to evaluate your bot's quality/cost/latency, even if ground truth is not available.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Quality Lab evaluates:
# MAGIC 1. Answer correctness - requires ground truth
# MAGIC 2. Hallucination / groundness - no ground truth required
# MAGIC 3. Answer relevance - no ground truth required
# MAGIC 4. Retrieval precision - no ground truth required
# MAGIC 5. (Lack of) Toxicity - no ground truth required
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this example, we'll use an evaluation set that we curated based on our internal experts using the Quality Lab review app interface.  This proper Eval Dataset is saved as a Delta Table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To see how to collect the dataset from the Eval App, see the [03-advanced-app/03-Offline-Evaluation]($../03-advanced-app/03-Offline-Evaluation) notebook.

# COMMAND ----------

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can open your MLFlow Experiment to review the different evaluation, and compare multiple model response to see how different prompts answer:

# MAGIC
# MAGIC This example was a simple demo. In the next set of notebooks, we'll go into more details and review how to prepare and split your documents, while working with more production-grade chain.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will also see how to deploy your [first Lakehouse Application](../02-simple-app/03-Deploy-Frontend-Lakehouse-App) to deploy the Assistant to your end-users!
