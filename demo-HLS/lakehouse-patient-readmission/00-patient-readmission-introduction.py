# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What is The Data Intelligence Platform for HLS?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It's the only enterprise data platform that allows you to leverage all your data, from any source, on any workload at the lowest cost.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 1. Simple
# MAGIC   One single platform and governance/security layer for your data warehousing and AI to **accelerate innovation** and **reduce risks**. No need to stitch together multiple solutions with disparate governance and high complexity.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 2. Open
# MAGIC   Open source in healthcare presents a pivotal opportunity for data ownership, prevention of vendor lock-in, and seamless integration with external solutions. By leveraging open standards, healthcare organizations gain the flexibility to share data with any external entity. This promotes interoperability, advances collaboration, and enables comprehensive data analysis, driving improved patient outcomes and operational efficiency.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### 3. Multicloud
# MAGIC   Adoption of a multi-cloud strategy in healthcare organizations is inevitable and integral to competitive success, delivering cost reduction, flexibility, and improved remote services.<br/>

# MAGIC ## DEMO: Predicting patient re-admissions 
# MAGIC Accurate prediction of patient readmissions holds immense value for hospitals and insurance companies:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ***Higher Quality Care:***
# MAGIC It enables hospitals to enhance patient care by proactively identifying individuals at a higher risk of readmission. By identifying these patients early on, healthcare providers can implement targeted interventions, such as personalized discharge plans, medication adherence support, or follow-up appointments, to mitigate the likelihood of readmissions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC  This approach not only improves patient outcomes but also reduces the burden on healthcare facilities and optimizes resource allocation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ***Cost Optimization***
# MAGIC Precise readmission prediction plays a pivotal role in cost containment for both hospitals and insurance groups. Hospital readmissions contribute significantly to healthcare expenditures, and accurate prediction can help identify patterns and risk factors associated with costly readmission cases. Developpigng proactive approach not only reduces healthcare costs but also promotes financial sustainability for hospitals and insurance providers.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks offers hospitals and insurance companies unique capabilities to predict readmissions and drive value. Databricks' holistic approach empowers healthcare organizations to leverage data effectively and achieve accurate readmission predictions while saving time and resources.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### What we will build
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To predict patient re-admissions, we'll build an end-to-end solution with the Lakehouse, leveraging data from external and internal systems: patient demographics, logitudinal health records (past visits, conditions, allergies, etc), and real-time patient admission, discharge, transofrm (ADT) information...  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC At a high level, we will implement the following flow:

# MAGIC <br><br>
# MAGIC Being able to run analysis on our past data already gave us a lot of insight to drive understand over-all patient risk factors.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC However, knowing re-admission risk in the past isn't enough. We now need to take it to the next level and build a predictive model to forecast risk. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is where the Lakehouse value comes in. Within the same platform, anyone can start building ML model to run such analysis, including low code solution with AutoML.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that all our lakehouse pipeline is working, we need to orchestrate all the different steps to deploy a production-grade pipeline. Typical steps involve:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Incrementally consume all new data every X hours (or in realtime)
# MAGIC - Refresh our dashboards
# MAGIC - Retrain and re-deploy our models
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks lakehouse provides Workflow, a complete orchestrator to build your pipeline, supporting taks with any kind of transformation.
