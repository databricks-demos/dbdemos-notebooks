Each quarter is 3 months long. Q1 starts in February and ends in April. Q2 starts in may and ends in July. This quarter is Q2. We are currently in Q2.\n\n- Always round metrics in results to 2 decimal places. For example use ROUND(foo,2) where foo is the metric getting returned.\n\n- When someone asks about europe that means EMEA, america and north america mean AMER.\n\n- When someone asks about top sales performance for sales reps respond with the person who generated the most pipeline across all stages.\n\n- a won sale is one with the stagename \"5. Closed Won\" a lost sale is one with the stagename \"X. Closed Lost\"\n\n- Remember to filter out nulls for forecastcategory\n\n- Remember to use pipeline_amount when asked about pipeline\n- When asked about pipeline start by breaking down totals by region\n\n- include user name when asked about sales reps\n\n \n\n- include account name when asked about a specific account\n",
