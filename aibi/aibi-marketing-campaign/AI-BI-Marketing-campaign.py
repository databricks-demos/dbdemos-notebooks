# MAGIC ## Marketing Campaign Analysis
# MAGIC ---
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### The Challenge
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Depending on their industry, organizations often spend anywhere from **7% to 25%** of their overall revenue collectively on marketing campaigns. While crucial to the business, organizations without a strong data intelligence platform struggle to unify siloed data, translate campaign outcomes to leadership, and experience tremendous slowdowns in time-to-analytics after a campaign.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### The Solution
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks' Intelligence Platform leverages **AI and Business Intelligence (_or as we call it, AI/BI_)** to democratize access to your organization's data. By integrating data from various marketing channels into a unified, cohesive environment, Databricks breaks down silos and makes comprehensive insights available to all team members. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Advanced AI-driven analytics and intuitive BI tools empower both technical and non-technical users to effortlessly analyze campaign performance by asking questions of their data platform in natural language. This accessibility accelerates time-to-insights, enhances collaboration across departments, and enables leadership to make informed, data-driven decisions that optimize marketing strategies and drive business growth.
