# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Fine Tuning or RAG?
# MAGIC RAG and Instruction fine-tuning work together! If you have a relevant RAG use-case, you can start with RAG leveraging a foundational model, and then specialize your model if your corpus is specific to your business (ex: not part of the foundation model training) or need specific behavior (ex: answer to a specific task such as entity extraction)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Start with RAG on a Foundation Model, evaluate how your model is working and where it can be improved, and build a Fine Tuned dataset accordingly!

# MAGIC ## Fine Tuning a Chatbot on Databricks Documentation 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will fine tune Mistral (or llama) on Databricks Documentation for a RAG chatbot to help a customer answer Databricks-related questions.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks provides a simple, built-in API to fine tune the model and evaluate its performance. Let's get started!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Documentation for Fine Tuning on Databricks:
# MAGIC - Overview page: [Databricks Fine-tuning APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/foundation-model-training/index.html)
# MAGIC - SDK Guide: [Setting up a fine-tuning session with Fine-tuning APIs](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/foundation-model-training/create-fine-tune-run.html)

%pip install databricks-sdk==0.27.1
%pip install "mlflow==2.12.2"
dbutils.library.restartPython()

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Building a high quality fine tuning dataset is key for improving your model's performance. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The training dataset needs to match the data you will be sending to your final model. <br/>
# MAGIC If you have a RAG application, you need to fine tune with the full RAG instruction pipeline so that your model can learn how to extract the proper information from the context and answer the way you want.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this demo, we have loaded a fine tuning dataset for you containing the following:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * A Databricks user question (ex: how do I start a Warehouse?)
# MAGIC * A page or chunk from Databricks documentation relevant to this question
# MAGIC * The expected answer, reviewed by a human

# MAGIC ## A note on Databricks Mosaic AI Evaluation Framework
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks makes it easy to build, deploy and review RAG application. Using Databricks review application, it's easy to build your Fine Tuning Dataset.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To see how it's done, install the `dbdemos.install('llm-rag-chatbot')` demo!

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because we're fine tuning a chatbot, we need to prepare our dataset for **Chat completion**.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Chat completion requires a list of **role** and **prompt**, following the OpenAI standard. This standard has the benefit of transforming our input into a prompt following our LLM instruction pattern. <br/>
# MAGIC Note that each foundation model might be trained with a different instruction type, so it's best to use the same type when fine tuning.<br/>
# MAGIC *We recommend using Chat Completion whenever possible.*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC [
# MAGIC   {"role": "system", "content": "[system prompt]"},
# MAGIC   {"role": "user", "content": "Here is a documentation page:[RAG context]. Based on this, answer the following question: [user question]"},
# MAGIC   {"role": "assistant", "content": "[answer]"}
# MAGIC ]
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Remember that your Fine Tuning dataset should be the same format as the one you're using for your RAG application.<br/>*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Training Data Type
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks supports a large variety of dataset formats (Volume files, Delta tables, and public Hugging Face datasets in .jsonl format), but we recommend preparing the dataset as Delta tables within your Catalog as part of a proper data pipeline to ensure production quality.
# MAGIC *Remember, this step is critical and you need to make sure your training dataset is of high quality.*
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's create a small pandas UDF to help create our final chat completion dataset.<br/>

# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is looking good! Fine tuning our model was just a simple API call. But how can we measure the improvement compared to the baseline model?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks makes this easy too! In the next section, we'll leverage MLFlow Evaluate capabilities to compare the fine tune model against the baseline Foundation Model to see how successful our tuning run was.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [02.2-llm-evaluation]($./02.2-llm-evaluation) notebook to benchmark our new custom LLM!
