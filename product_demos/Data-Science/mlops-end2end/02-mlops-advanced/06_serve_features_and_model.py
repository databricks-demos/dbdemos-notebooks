# MAGIC # Churn Prediction Realtime Inference
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have just seen how to get predictions in batches. Now, we will deploy the features and model to make realtime predictions via REST API call. Customer application teams can embed this predictive capability into customer-facing applications and apply a retention strategy for customers predicted to churn as they interact with the application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because the predictions are to be made in a customer-facing application as the customer interacts with it, they have to be returned with low-latency.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC To serve the features and model, we will:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Make the features available for low-latency retrieval by the model through Databrick's online tables
# MAGIC - Deploy the registered model from Unity Catalog to a Model Serving endpoint for low latency serving
# MAGIC
# MAGIC These tasks can be done in the UI. They can also be automated by leveraging the Databricks Python SDK ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/dev-tools/sdk-python.html#)|[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/sdk-python)|[GCP](https://docs.gcp.databricks.com/dev-tools/sdk-python.html)) available in Databricks Runtime 13.3LTS+

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Install Databricks Python SDK [for MLR < 13.3] and MLflow version for model lineage in UC [for MLR < 15.2]
# MAGIC %pip install --quiet mlflow==2.14.3

# MAGIC # Serve features with Databricks online tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For serving predictions queries with low-latency, publish the features to Databricks online tables and serve them in real time to the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC During the feature engineering step, we have created a Delta Table as an offline feature table. Recall that any Delta Table that has a primary key can be a feature table in Databricks.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Enable Change-Data-Feed on Feature Table for performance considerations
# MAGIC
# MAGIC An online table is a read-only copy of a Delta Table that is stored in row-oriented format optimized for online access. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks allows the online tables to be refreshed efficiently whenever there are updates to the underlying feature tables. This is enabled through the Change Data Feed feature of Delta Lake. Let us first enable Change Data Feed on the underlying feature table `churn_feature_table`.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC ALTER TABLE advanced_churn_feature_table SET TBLPROPERTIES (delta.enableChangeDataFeed = true)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Create the Online Table
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You can create an online table from the Catalog Explorer UI, or by using the API. The steps are described below. For more details, see the Databricks documentation ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/feature-store/online-tables.html#create)|[Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/databricks/machine-learning/feature-store/online-tables#create)).

# MAGIC ## Review Featurization Logic to compute features on-demand
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have deployed the online table and features are now available on-demand at low latency to the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Recall that we have also defined a function earlier to calculate the `avg_price_increase` feature on-demand. Let's review the function here.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This function was specified as a feature function when creating the training dataset with the Feature Engineering Client in the model training notebook. This information is logged with the model in MLflow. That means that at serving time, not only does the model know to retrieve features from the online table, but it also know that the `avg_price_increase` feature has to be computed on-demand using this function.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC DESCRIBE FUNCTION EXTENDED avg_price_increase;

# MAGIC %md-sandbox
# MAGIC # Deploying the model for real-time inference
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To make the model available for real-time inference through a REST API we will deploy to a Model Serving endpoint.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our marketing team can point customer-facing applications used by many concurrent customers to this endpoint. Databricks makes it easy for ML teams to deploy this type of low-latency and high-concurrency applications. Model Serving handles all the infrastructure, deployment and scaling for you. You just need to deploy the model!

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Promote model for real-time serving
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have seen earlier how to use the `@Champion` and `@Challenger` aliases to promote models to be called in a batch pipeline.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Since real-time inference is another way the model will be consumed, we need a workflow to ensure the model is deployed safely. You can adopt different strategies to deploy a new model version as an endpoint. We will look at  A/B testing as an example here. Other strategies include canary deploying, shadow testing, etc.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In A/B testing, there is a 'live' model served in production. When we have a new model version, we want to divert a percentage of our online traffic to this new model version. We let the new model version predict if these customers will churn, and compare the results to that of the 'live' model. We monitor the results. If the results are acceptable, then we divert all traffic to the new model version, and it now becomes the new 'live' version.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's introduce a third alias, `@Production` to track this workflow:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - `@Production`: Production model that is 'live'
# MAGIC - `@Champion`: New model version that was promoted after Champion-Challenger testing
# MAGIC - `@Challenger`: Model that challenges the Champion. Never gets deployed for real-time serving unless promoted to Champion.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Model Serving lets you deploy multiple model versions to a serving endpoint and specify a traffic split between these versions. For example, when there is a new Champion model to be A/B tested, you can route 20% of the traffic to the the Champion model and let the Production model process only 80%.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC <br>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Since we are deplying a model as an endpoint for the first time, we will promote set the `@Production` alias to the Champion model and deploy it for serving against 100% traffic.

# COMMAND ----------

# Fully qualified model name
model_name = f"{catalog}.{db}.advanced_mlops_churn"

# COMMAND ----------

# Promote Champion model to Production

print(f"Promoting {model_name} versions {model_version} from Champion to Production")

# MAGIC ## Create the Model Serving endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll now create the Model Serving endpoint. This is very simple once the model has been registered in Unity Catalog. You can do it through the UI, or by using the API.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Fill in the following fields:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Name**: `dbdemos_mlops_advanced_churn`
# MAGIC   * This is the name of the serving endpoint
# MAGIC * **Entity**: Type `mlops_churn` and choose the model registered from the previous notebooks.
# MAGIC   * This is the Unity Catalog-registered model that you want to serve.
# MAGIC * **Compute type**: Leave it as **CPU**
# MAGIC   * This is the column in the source table to use as the timeseries key.
# MAGIC * **Compute scale out**: Choose **Small**
# MAGIC   * This determines how many concurrent requests the endpoint can handle.
# MAGIC * **Scale to zero**: Keep it checked
# MAGIC   * This allows the serving endpoint to scale down to zero when there are no requests
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Click **Create** and wait for the endpoint to provision. Be patient, as this can take more than an hour. Take a break and check back later.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When the endpoint is ready, it should show that the status is **Ready**.
