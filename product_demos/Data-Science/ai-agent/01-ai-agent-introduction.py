# MAGIC Databricks makes it easy to create and register your own Agents and tools to manipulate your data, and also any other external system (from openai agent sdk, claude agents to MCP servers).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC But building your agent is only the first step to deploy your production and drive business impact!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we will be building an agent for your customer support team. It'll be able to process your customer support request, and provide guidance, ultimately **accelerating your time to resolution, increasing satisfaction and reducing costs!**
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You will need the following steps, and Databricks makes it easier than ever:

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's start by creating our first tools. We'll create a few functions to help your customer support team to find customer information, and register them in your Catalog/Schema. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Remember, this could be any functions!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open [01-create-tools/01_create_first_billing_agent]($./01-create-tools/01_create_first_billing_agent) to get started

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our tools are ready, we'll create an Agent using Langchain and give equip the agent with the tools we previously created!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our agent created, we'll start running a first Evaluation round against an existing evaluation dataset, and improve our prompt to make it better and have better eval metrics!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open [02-agent-eval/02.1_agent_evaluation]($./02-agent-eval/02.1_agent_evaluation) to deploy and evaluate your agent.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 3/ Add a Knowledge base
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our agent is working well, but cannot answer questions on our internal product and procedure.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It's time to add a knowledge base, extracting information from PDF and adding a vector search to enrich our context with custom information in our prompt!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC And of course, we'll close the loop by re-evaluating our agent, making sure we keep improving it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open [03-knowledge-base-rag/03.1-pdf-rag-tool]($./03-knowledge-base-rag/03.1-pdf-rag-tool) to add your Knowledge base.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 4/ Deploy your agent using Databricks Application, capturing Customer Feedback in MLFlow
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our agent is ready, we can deploy it using Databricks Application.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For our demo, we'll release a simple GradIO chatbot application to show you how to capture user feedback within MLFlow, and use it to improve your eval set and your model performance over time!
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open [04-deploy-app/04-Deploy-Frontend-Lakehouse-App]($./04-deploy-app/04-Deploy-Frontend-Lakehouse-App) to get started.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## 5/ Add live, production monitoring to your agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our frontend application is now live! Our next step is to add a monitoring to evaluate all the incoming user requests, and make sure they respect our evaluation metrics over time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open [05-production-monitoring/05.production-monitoring]($./05-production-monitoring/05.production-monitoring) to add Production Monitoring to your agents!

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Out last step is to measure how your agent impact your business!
