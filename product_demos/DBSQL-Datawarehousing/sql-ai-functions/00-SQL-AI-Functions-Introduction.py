# MAGIC # 1/ Process and analyse text with Built In Databricks SQL AI functions
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks SQL provides [built-in GenAI capabilities](https://docs.databricks.com/en/large-language-models/ai-functions.html), letting you perform adhoc operation, leveraging state of the art LLM, optimized for these tasks.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Discover how to leverage functions such as  `ai_analyze_sentiment`,  `ai_classify` or `ai_gen` with Databricks SQL. In addition, Databricks AI Functions are fully serverless which delivers 10x faster performance with no requirement of setting up inference endpoint and manage infrastructure.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [01-Builtin-SQL-AI-Functions]($./01-Builtin-SQL-AI-Functions) to get started with Databricks SQL AI builtin functions.

# MAGIC # 2/ Going Further: Actioning Customer Reviews at Scale with Databricks SQL AI Functions and custom Model Endpoint (LLM or other)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks builtin AI functions are powerful and let you quickly achieve many tasks with text.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC However, you might sometime require more fine-grained control and select wich Foundation Model you want to call (Mistral, Llama, Dbrx, OpenAI or one of your own fine-tuning model), passing specific instruction. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC You might also need to query your own fine-tuned LLMs, providing a solution to leverage small models to perform extremely well on specialized tasks, at a lower cost.

# MAGIC ## Use-case: Increasing customer satisfaction and churn reduction with automatic reviews analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we'll build a data pipeline that takes customer reviews as text, analyze them by leveraging LLMs (Databricks Foundation Model Llama or Mistral). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll even provide recommendations for next best actions to our customer service team - i.e. whether a customer requires follow-up, and a sample message to follow-up with.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For each review, we:
# MAGIC - Extract information such as sentiment and whether a response is required back to the customer
# MAGIC - Generate a response mentioning alternative products that may satisfy the customer

# MAGIC ## 2.1/ Introducing Databricks AI_QUERY() function: generating dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks provide a `ai_query()` function that you can use to call any model endpoint. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This lets you wrap functions around any Model Serving Endpoint. Your endpoint can then implement any logic (a Foundation Model, a more advanced Chain Of Thought, or a classic ML model). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC AI Functions abstracts away the technical complexities of calling LLMs, enabling analysts and data scientists to start using these models without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this demo, we use one of our [Foundation models](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/foundation-models/index.html), [Llama 3.3 70B Instruct](https://www.databricks.com/blog/making-ai-more-accessible-80-cost-savings-meta-llama-33-databricks) as our LLM that will be used by AI_QUERY() to generate fake reviews. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the next Notebook to generate some sample data for our demo: [02-Generate-fake-data-with-AI-functions]($./02-Generate-fake-data-with-AI-functions)
