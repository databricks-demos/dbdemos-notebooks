# MAGIC ## Challenges moving ML project into production
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Moving ML project from a standalone notebook to a production-grade data pipeline is complex and require multiple competencies.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Having a model up and running in a notebook isn't enough. We need to cover the end to end ML Project life cycle and solve the following challenges:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Update data over time (production-grade ingestion pipeline)
# MAGIC * How to save, share and re-use ML features in the organization
# MAGIC * How to ensure a new model version respect quality standard and won't break the pipeline
# MAGIC * Model governance: what is deployed, how is it trained, by who, which data?
# MAGIC * How to monitor and re-train the model...
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In addition, these project typically invole multiple teams, creating friction and potential silos
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Data Engineers, in charge of ingesting, preparing and exposing the data
# MAGIC * Data Scientist, expert in data analysis, building ML model
# MAGIC * ML engineers, setuping the ML infrastructure pipelines (similar to devops)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This has a real impact on the business, slowing down projects and preventing them from being deployed in production and bringing ROI.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What's MLOps ?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLOps is is a set of standards, tools, processes and methodology that aims to optimize time, efficiency and quality while ensuring governance in ML projects.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLOps orchestrate a project life-cycle and adds the glue required between the component and teams to smoothly implement such ML pipelines.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks is uniquely positioned to solve this challenge with the Lakehouse pattern. Not only we bring Data Engineers, Data Scientists and ML Engineers together in a unique platform, but we also provide tools to orchestrate ML project and accelerate the go to production.

# MAGIC ## MLOps process walkthrough
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this quickstart demo, we'll walkthrough a few common steps in the MLOps process. The end result of this process is a model used to power a dashboard for downstream business stakeholders which is:
# MAGIC * preparing features
# MAGIC * training a model for deployment
# MAGIC * registering the model for its use to be goverened
# MAGIC * validating the model in a champion-challenger analysis
# MAGIC * invoking a trained ML model as a pySpark UDF

# MAGIC - Realtime Feature serving with Online Tables
# MAGIC - A/B testing 
# MAGIC - Automated re-training
# MAGIC - Infra setup abd hooks with Databricks MLOps Stack

# MAGIC ## Customer churn detection
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To explore MLOps, we'll be implementing a customer churn model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our marketing team asked us to create a Dashboard tracking Churn risk evolution. In addition, we need to provide our renewal team with a daily list of customers at Churn risk to increase our final revenue.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our Data Engineer team provided us a dataset collecting information on our customer base, including churn information. That's where our implementation starts.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see how we can implement such a model, but also provide our marketing and renewal team with Dashboards to track and analyze our Churn prediction.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Ultimately, you'll build able to build a complete DBSQL Churn Dashboard containing all our customer & churn information, but also start a Genie space to ask any question using plain english!
