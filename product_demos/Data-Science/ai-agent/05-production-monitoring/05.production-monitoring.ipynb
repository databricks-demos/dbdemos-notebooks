    "# Production Monitoring: Automated Quality at Scale\n",
    "\n",
    "MLflow's production monitoring automatically runs quality assessments on a sample of your production traffic, ensuring your GenAI app maintains high quality standards without manual intervention. MLflow lets you use the same metrics you defined for offline evaluation in production, enabling you to have consistent quality evaluation across your entire application lifecycle - dev to prod.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key benefits:** \n",
    "\n",
    "- Automated evaluation - Run LLM judges on production traces with configurable sampling rates\n",
    "- Continuous quality assessment - Monitor quality metrics in real-time without disrupting user experience\n",
    "- Cost-effective monitoring - Smart sampling strategies to balance coverage with computational cost\n",
    "\n",
    "Production monitoring enables you to deploy confidently, knowing that you will proactively detect issues so you can address them before they cause a major impact to your users.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more details on generative AI monitoring refer to the [Monitor served models using AI Gateway-enabled inference tables](https://docs.databricks.com/gcp/en/ai-gateway/inference-tables) and [Production quality monitoring](https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/mlflow3/genai/eval-monitor/run-scorer-in-prod) documentation.\n",
