    "# üîç Gen AI-Powered Credit Decisioning in Modern Banking\n",
    "Modern banks face mounting challenges in credit risk assessment as customers‚Äô financial profiles become more dynamic and regulatory expectations for transparency and fairness increase. Legacy credit decisioning systems, which rely on static rules and manual reviews, are slow, inconsistent, and often fail to surface nuanced risk factors or explain model decisions. To manage risk appropriately and expand access to credit, especially for underbanked customers, banks need intelligent automation and real-time insights. Generative AI (GenAI) and machine learning are now essential to deliver the speed, accuracy, and explainability that today‚Äôs credit markets demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ÄúGenAI is transforming credit underwriting by automating credit memo generation, integrating with financial systems, and enhancing decision-making. It streamlines data analysis, reduces errors, and frees up lending teams to focus on strategy.‚Äù\n",

    "## The Demo: Automate Credit Decision Reports with Databricks GenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging GenAI in credit assessment: \n",
    "- Banks reduce turnaround time from days to minutes.\n",
    "- All decisions become explainable and defensible, a key regulatory requirement.\n",
    "- Lenders unlock new markets, making credit available to customers previously excluded by rigid legacy scoring.\n",
    "- Audit, quality assurance, and compliance become embedded within every decision, not an afterthought.\n",

    "GenAI-powered credit automation, powered by Databricks, gives banks a single unified platform to manage, explain, and continually improve their credit risk practices in an evolving market\n",
    "\n",
    "In this demo, we showcase a practical use case for Databricks to improve credit decision system in modern banking. We will create an AI agent using the following functions, defined in the subsequent cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Credit Information Retriever**: This function allows our GenAI agent to fetch detailed customer credit information for any given customer id, pulling structured and unstructured data from our Databricks Intelligence Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Credit Decision Report Generator**: Using generative AI models, this function creates clear, structured credit decision reports , highlighting risk factors, behavioral anomalies, and relevant customer context for further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will demonstrate how these functions can be applied in batch to analyze all the credit decisions for a customer. By automating credit decision report generation and enabling real-time access to enriched data, banks can improve operational efficiency, accelerate decision making power, and enhance compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Generative AI, banks can move beyond manual processes to **streamline workflows, reduce costs, and significantly strengthen Credit Risk Analysis capabilities**."
