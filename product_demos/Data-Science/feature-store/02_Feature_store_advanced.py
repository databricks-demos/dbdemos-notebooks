# MAGIC # Feature store Travel Agency recommendation - Advanced
# MAGIC
# MAGIC For this demo, we'll go deeper in the Feature Store capabilities, adding multiple Feature Store table and introducing point in time lookup.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll use the same dataset as before and implement the same use-case: recommender model for a Travel agency, pushing personalized offer based on what our customers are the most likely to buy.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **What you will learn:**
# MAGIC - Build more advanced features with multiple tables
# MAGIC - Introduce timestamp key, to simplify temporal feature management
# MAGIC - Use AutoML to create the best model for us
# MAGIC - Online table, synchronizing Databricks Delta Table with a real time, low latency table automatically used by your model to lookup features.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this second example, we'll introduce more tables and new features calculated with window functions.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To simplify updates & refresh, we'll split them in 2 tables:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **User features**: contains all the features for a given user in a given point in time (location, previous purchases if any etc)
# MAGIC * **Destination features**: data on the travel destination for a given point in time (interest tracked by the number of clicks & impression)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Point-in-time support for feature tables
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks Feature Store supports use cases that require point-in-time correctness.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The data used to train a model often has time dependencies built into it. In our case, because we are adding rolling-window features, our Feature Table will contain data on all the dataset timeframe. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC When we build our model, we must consider only feature values up until the time of the observed target value. If you do not explicitly take into account the timestamp of each observation, you might inadvertently use feature values measured after the timestamp of the target value for training. This is called “data leakage” and can negatively affect the model’s performance.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Time series feature tables include a timestamp key column that ensures that each row in the training dataset represents the latest known feature values as of the row’s timestamp. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In our case, this timestamp key will be the `ts` field, present in our 2 feature tables.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### Calculating the features
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's calculate the aggregated features from the vacation purchase logs for destinations and users. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The user features capture the user profile information such as past purchased price. Because the booking data does not change very often, it can be computed once per day in batch.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The destination features include popularity features such as impressions and clicks, as well as pricing features such as price at the time of booking.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC While you can do that using the UI directly (+New => AutoML), we'll be using the `databricks.automl` API to have a reproductible flow.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After running the previous cell, you will notice two notebooks and an MLflow experiment:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * **Data exploration notebook**: we can see a Profiling Report which organizes the input columns and discusses values, frequency and other information
# MAGIC * **Best trial notebook**: shows the source code for reproducing the best trial conducted by AutoML
# MAGIC * **MLflow experiment**: contains high level information, such as the root artifact location, experiment ID, and experiment tags. The list of trials contains detailed summaries of each trial, such as the notebook and model location, training parameters, and overall metrics.

# MAGIC ## Summary 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We've seen how the feature store can handle multiple tables, leverage a more advanced model with Databricks AutoML and use point-in-time lookup when your dataset contains temporal information and you don't want the future information to leak.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC On top of that, we saw how Databricks Online table can provide realtime capabilities for K/V queries, automatically backed 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Databricks Feature store brings you a full traceability, knowing which model is using which feature in which notebook/job.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It also simplify inferences by always making sure the same features will be used for model training and inference, always querying the same feature table based on your lookup keys.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Next Steps 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [03_Feature_store_expert notebook]($./03_Feature_store_expert) to explore more Feature Store benefits & capabilities:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Multiple lookup tables
# MAGIC - Streaming datasets
# MAGIC - On-demand feature computation wrapped with the model with Feature Spec
# MAGIC - Online feature store
# MAGIC - Real time model serving with Rest Endpoints
