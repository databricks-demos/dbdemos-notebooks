# MAGIC # Fraud Detection - Single click deployment with AutoML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see how we can now leverage the Banking data to build a model rating our Fraud risk on each transaction.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our first step as Data Scientist is to analyze and build the features we'll use to train our model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The transaction table enriched with customer data has been saved within our Delta Live Table pipeline. All we have to do is read this information, analyze it and start an Auto-ML run.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Data exploration and analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's review our dataset and start analyze the data we have to detect fraud

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### 1- How much fraud are we talking about?
# MAGIC Based on the existing rules, while 3% of the transactions are fraudulent, it takes into account of the 9% of the total amount.   

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Leverage built-in visualizations to explore your dataset
# MAGIC %sql
# MAGIC select 
# MAGIC   is_fraud,
# MAGIC   count(1) as `Transactions`, 
# MAGIC   sum(amount) as `Total Amount` 
# MAGIC from gold_transactions
# MAGIC group by is_fraud
# MAGIC
# MAGIC --Visualization Pie chart: Keys: is_fraud, Values: [Transactions, Total Amount]

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC As expected, financial fraud is by nature very imbalanced between fraudulant and normal transactions

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md ### 2- What type of transactions are associated with fraud?
# MAGIC Reviewing the rules-based model, it appears that most fraudulent transactions are in the category of `Transfer` and `Cash_Out`.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Run analysis using your usual python plot libraries
df = spark.sql('select type, is_fraud, count(1) as count from gold_transactions group by type, is_fraud').toPandas()

fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, specs=[[{'type':'domain'}, {'type':'domain'}]])
fig.add_trace(go.Pie(labels=df[df['is_fraud']]['type'], values=df[df['is_fraud']]['count'], title="Fraud Transactions", hole=0.6), 1, 1)
fig.add_trace(go.Pie(labels=df[~df['is_fraud']]['type'], values=df[~df['is_fraud']]['count'], title="Normal Transactions", hole=0.6) ,1, 2)

# MAGIC ## Saving our dataset to Feature Store (Optional)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/QuentinAmbard/databricks-demo/raw/main/product_demos/mlops-end2end-flow-feature-store.png" style="float:right" width="500" />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our features are ready, we'll save them in Databricks Feature Store. Under the hood, features store are backed by a Delta Lake table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This will allow discoverability and reusability of our feature accross our organization, increasing team efficiency.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Feature store will bring traceability and governance in our deployment, knowing which model is dependent of which set of features. It also simplify realtime serving.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make sure you're using the "Machine Learning" menu to have access to your feature store using the UI.

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Create the final features using pandas API
# Convert to koalas
dataset = spark.table('gold_transactions').dropDuplicates(['id']).pandas_api()
# Drop columns we don't want to use in our model
# Typical DS project would include more transformations / cleanup here
dataset = dataset.drop(columns=['address', 'email', 'firstname', 'lastname', 'creation_date', 'last_activity_date', 'customer_id'])

# Drop missing values
dataset.dropna()
dataset.describe()

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Save them to our feature store
from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

try:
  #drop table if exists
  fs.drop_table(f'{catalog}.{db}.transactions_features')
except:
  pass

fs.create_table(
  name=f'{catalog}.{db}.transactions_features',
  primary_keys='id',
  schema=dataset.spark.schema(),
  description='These features are derived from the gold_transactions table in the lakehouse.  We created dummy variables for the categorical columns, cleaned up their names, and added a boolean flag for whether the transaction is a fraud or not.  No aggregations were performed.')

fs.write_table(df=dataset.to_spark(), name=f'{catalog}.{db}.transactions_features', mode='overwrite')
features = fs.read_table(f'{catalog}.{db}.transactions_features')
display(features)

# MAGIC ## Accelerating Fraud detection model creation using MLFlow and Databricks Auto-ML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow is an open source project allowing model tracking, packaging and deployment. Everytime your datascientist team work on a model, Databricks will track all the parameter and data used and will save it. This ensure ML traceability and reproductibility, making it easy to know which model was build using which parameters/data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### AutoML: A glass-box solution that empowers data teams without taking away control
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While Databricks simplify model deployment and governance (MLOps) with MLFlow, bootstraping new ML projects can still be long and inefficient. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Instead of creating the same boilerplate for each new project, Databricks Auto-ML can automatically generate state of the art models for Classifications, regression, and forecast.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img width="1000" src="https://github.com/QuentinAmbard/databricks-demo/raw/main/retail/resources/images/auto-ml-full.png"/>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Models can be directly deployed, or instead leverage generated notebooks to boostrap projects with best-practices, saving you weeks of efforts.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Using Databricks Auto ML with our Transaction dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Auto ML is available in the "Machine Learning" space. All we have to do is start a new Auto-ML experimentation and select the feature table we just created (`gold_transactions`)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our prediction target is the `is_fraud` column.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Click on Start, and Databricks will do the rest.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While this is done using the UI, you can also leverage the [python API](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/automl.html#automl-python-api-1)

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Starting AutoML run using Databricks API
from databricks import automl

xp_path = "/Shared/dbdemos/experiments/lakehouse-fsi-fraud-detection"
xp_name = f"automl_fraud_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y-%m-%d_%H:%M:%S')}"
automl_run = automl.classify(
    experiment_name = xp_name,
    experiment_dir = xp_path,
    dataset = features.sample(0.05), #drastically reduce the training size to speedup the demo
    target_col = "is_fraud",
    timeout_minutes = 15
)
#Make sure all users can access dbdemos shared experiment
DBDemos.set_experiment_permission(f"{xp_path}/{xp_name}")

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC AutoML saved our best model in the MLFlow registry. [Open the dbdemos_fsi fraud model](#mlflow/models/dbdemos_fsi_fraud) to explore its artifact and analyze the parameters used, including traceability to the notebook used for its creation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If we're ready, we can move this model into Production stage in a click, or using the API.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ## Next: deploying our model for Real Time fraud detection serving 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our model has been created with Databricks AutoML, we can start a Model Endpoint to serve low-latencies fraud detection.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll be able to rate the Fraud likelihood in ms to reduce fraud in real-time.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [04.3-Model-serving-realtime-inference-fraud]($./04.3-Model-serving-realtime-inference-fraud) to deploy our model or review the notebook generated by AutoML [04.2-automl-generated-notebook-fraud]($./04.2-automl-generated-notebook-fraud).
