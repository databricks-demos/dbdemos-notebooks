# MAGIC %md-sandbox # Deploying the Agent System for Prescriptive Maintenance using the Mosaic AI Agent Framework
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that have created the Mosaic AI Tools in Unity Catalog, we will leverage the Mosaic AI Agent Framework to build, deploy and evaluate an AI agent for Prescriptive Maintenance. The Agent Framework comprises a set of tools on Databricks designed to help developers build, deploy, and evaluate production-quality AI agents like Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Moreover, Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation provides a platform to capture and implement human feedback, ground truth, response and request logs, LLM judge feedback, chain traces, and more.

# MAGIC This notebook uses Mosaic AI Agent Framework ([AWS](https://docs.databricks.com/en/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation.html) | [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/generative-ai/retrieval-augmented-generation)) to deploy the prescriptive maintenance agent defined in [05.2-agent-framework-iot-turbine-prescriptive-maintenance]($./05.2-build-agent-iot-turbine-prescriptive-maintenance) notebook. This notebook does the following:
# MAGIC 1. Logs the agent to MLflow
# MAGIC 2. Evaluate the agent with Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC 3. Registers the agent to Unity Catalog
# MAGIC 4. Deploys the agent to a Model Serving endpoint
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is an high-level overview of the agent system that we will deploy in this demo:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The resulting prescriptive maintenance agent is able to perform a variety of prescriptive actions to augment maintenance technicians, including:
# MAGIC - Predicting turbine failure
# MAGIC - Retrieving specification information about turbines
# MAGIC - Generating maintenance work orders using past maintenance reports
# MAGIC - Answering follow-up questions about work orders
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Next steps
# MAGIC
# MAGIC After your agent is deployed, you can chat with it in AI playground to perform additional checks, share it with SMEs in your organization for feedback, or embed it in a production application.

The reports suggest that the turbine may be experiencing pitch system misalignment, high gearbox temperature, or blade delamination.
To address these issues, it is recommended to conduct comprehensive diagnostic tests of the pitch system, inspect the gearbox internals, and perform non-destructive testing on the blades. Additionally, regular maintenance procedures such as lubrication of moving parts, inspection of hydraulic lines, and vibration analysis can help prevent future malfunctions.
Specifically, the recommended solutions include:
Conducting comprehensive diagnostic tests of the pitch system and repairing or replacing faulty components
Inspecting the gearbox internals and replacing worn-out bearings, realigning gear meshes, and replenishing gearbox oil
Conducting non-destructive testing on the blades and repairing delaminated sections using composite patching materials or adhesive bonding techniques
Implementing regular maintenance procedures such as lubrication, inspection, and vibration analysis to prevent future issues.
It is also important to monitor the turbine's condition regularly and perform preventative maintenance to address any emerging issues promptly."""

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Deploy the agent
# MAGIC For PyFunc flavored agents, you must manually specify any resource dependencies during logging of the deployed agent in the resources parameter (see above under: "Log the `agent` as an MLflow model"). During deployment, databricks.agents.deploy creates an M2M OAuth token with access to the resources specified in the resources parameter, and deploys it to the deployed agent. For the DBSQL [vector_search function](https://docs.databricks.com/en/sql/language-manual/functions/vector_search.html) automatic authentication passthrough is supported. However, `vector_search function` doesn't support `DIRECT ACCESS` indexes (which we created before in [05.1-ai-tools-iot-turbine-prescriptive-maintenance]($./05.1-ai-tools-iot-turbine-prescriptive-maintenance) notebook). Therefore, we have to reference the secret in the model serving by specifying the secrets-based `environment vars`. This allows credentials to be fetched at serving time from model serving endpoints (see [Documentation](https://docs.databricks.com/en/machine-learning/model-serving/store-env-variable-model-serving.html#add-secrets-based-environment-variables)).

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks import agents

# Deploy the model to the review app and a model serving endpoint
agents.deploy(UC_MODEL_NAME, uc_registered_model_info.version, tags = {"endpointSource": "playground"})

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC During deployment a system service principal was automatically created. To be able to query the agent from the Model Serving endpoint or the AI playground, we have to give this service principal read access to the secret scope. The system service principal ID can be found in the model serving endpoint events, which looks like this:
