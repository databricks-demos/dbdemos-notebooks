# MAGIC # Scaling your business with a GenAI-Powered Assistant and DBRX Instruct
# MAGIC
# MAGIC LLMs are disrupting the way we interact with information, from internal knowledge bases to external, customer-facing documentation or support.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC While ChatGPT democratized LLM-based chatbots for consumer use, companies need to deploy personalized models that answer their needs:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Privacy requirements on sensitive information
# MAGIC - Preventing hallucination
# MAGIC - Specialized content, not available on the Internet
# MAGIC - Specific behavior for customer tasks
# MAGIC - Control over speed and cost
# MAGIC - Deploy models on private infrastructure for security reasons
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Introducing Mosaic AI Agent Evaluation
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To solve these challenges, custom knowledge bases and models need to be deployed. However, doing so at scale isn't simple and requires:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Ingesting and transforming massive amounts of data 
# MAGIC - Ensuring privacy and security across your data pipeline
# MAGIC - Deploying systems such as Vector Search Index 
# MAGIC - Having access to GPUs and deploying efficient LLMs for inference serving
# MAGIC - Training and deploying custom models
# MAGIC - Evaluating your RAG application
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is where the Databricks AI comes in. Databricks simplifies all these steps so that you can focus on building your final model, with the best prompts and performance.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Deploying GenAI can be done in multiple ways:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - **Prompt engineering on public APIs (e.g. Databricks DBRX Instruct, LLama 2, openAI)**: answer from public information, retail (think ChatGPT)
# MAGIC - **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)**: specialize your model with additional content. *This is what we'll focus on in this demo*
# MAGIC - **OSS model Fine tuning**: when you have a large corpus of custom data and need specific model behavior (execute a task)
# MAGIC - **Train your own LLM**: for full control on the underlying data sources of the model (biomedical, Code, Finance...)

# MAGIC ## What is Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) for LLMs?
# MAGIC

# MAGIC
# MAGIC RAG is a powerful and efficient GenAI technique that allows you to improve model performance by leveraging your own data (e.g., documentation specific to your business), without the need to fine-tune the model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This is done by providing your custom information as context to the LLM. This reduces hallucination and allows the LLM to produce results that provide company-specific data, without making any changes to the original LLM.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC RAG has shown success in chatbots and Q&A systems that need to maintain up-to-date information or access domain-specific knowledge.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### RAG and Vector Search
# MAGIC
# MAGIC To be able to provide additional context to our LLM, we need to search for documents/articles where the answer to our user question might be.
# MAGIC To do so,  a common solution is to deploy a vector database. This involves the creation of document embeddings, vectors of fixed size representing your document.<br/>
# MAGIC The vectors will then be used to perform real-time similarity search during inference.
