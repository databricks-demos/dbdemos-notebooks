    "In this demo, we showcase a practical use case for Databricks to improve credit decision system in modern banking. We will create an AI agent using the following functions, defined in the subsequent cells:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Customer Credit Information Retriever**: This function allows our GenAI agent to fetch detailed customer credit information for any given customer id, pulling structured and unstructured data from our Databricks Intelligence Platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Credit Decision Report Generator**: Using generative AI models, this function creates clear, structured credit decision reports , highlighting risk factors, behavioral anomalies, and relevant customer context for further review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we will demonstrate how these functions can be applied in batch to analyze all the credit decisions for a customer. By automating credit decision report generation and enabling real-time access to enriched data, banks can improve operational efficiency, accelerate decision making power, and enhance compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Generative AI, banks can move beyond manual processes to **streamline workflows, reduce costs, and significantly strengthen Credit Risk Analysis capabilities**."
