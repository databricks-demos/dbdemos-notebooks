    "    - Consider the total number of items in their last order when pushing for package deal. For example, if the total number of items is less than 5, push for package deal. If the total number of items is greater than 5, push for a free shipping offer.\\n\n",
    "    - Consider the days elapsed since the last purchased date when writing copy. For example, if the time elapsed is less than 30 days, push for discount. If the time elapsed is greater than 30 days, push for a free shipping offer.\\n\n",
    "    - Consider the current date when writing copy to take into account the seasonality of the country. For example, if the current season is Summer in the customer's country, promote for some products in summer and vice versa.\\n\n",
    "    - If the customer is at risk at churning, add urgency to the copy. Never explicitly mention the customer's churn status.\\n\n",
