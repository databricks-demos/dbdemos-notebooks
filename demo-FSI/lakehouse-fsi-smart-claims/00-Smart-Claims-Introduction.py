# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## What is The Insurance Databricks Data Intelligence Platform for Financial Services?
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It's the only enterprise data platform that allows you to leverage all your data, from any source, on any workload to always offer more engaging customer experiences driven by real time data, at the lowest cost.

# MAGIC   <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Simple</h3></div>
# MAGIC   One single platform and governance/security layer for your data warehousing and AI to <strong>accelerate innovation</strong> and <strong>reduce risks</strong>. <br>
# MAGIC   No need to stitch together multiple solutions with disparate governance and high complexity.
# MAGIC </div>
# MAGIC <div style="width: 30%; float: left; margin: 0px 0px 0px 0px; background-color: #fafbff; padding: 15px; min-height: 230px;">
# MAGIC   <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Open</h3></div>
# MAGIC   Built on open source and open standards. You own your data and <strong>prevent vendor lock-in</strong>, with easy integration with external solution. <br>
# MAGIC   Being open also lets you share your data with any external organization, regardless of their data stack/vendor.

# MAGIC   <div style="text-align: center"><h3>Multicloud</h3></div>
# MAGIC   Multicloud is one of the key strategic considerations for FS companies, with 88% of single-cloud FS customers are adopting a <strong>multi-cloud architecture</strong> (<a href="https://www.fstech.co.uk/fst/88_Of_FIs_Considering_Multicloud.php">reference</a>). The Lakehouse provides one consistent data platform across clouds and gives companies the ability to process your data where your need.

# MAGIC %md-sandbox
# MAGIC ## Accelerate claims processing by automating insight generation and decision process
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll showcase how the Lakehouse can accelerate claims resolution and reduce fraud risks for car crash.<br/>
# MAGIC In traditional flow, claims transit through an <b>operational</b> system such as Guidewire and an <b>analytic</b> system such as Databricks as shown in the diagram below. <br/>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here is the application we will implement:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img width="800px" src="https://github.com/databricks-demos/dbdemos-resources/blob/main/images/fsi/smart-claims/smart_claims_process.png?raw=true" />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We will consume informations from our main operational system:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC - Customer profile information including their policy details
# MAGIC - Customer Telematics: an app that collects driving metrics (location, speed, how you turn, braking habits...)
# MAGIC - Claims details: contains the claim information, including damage photos (car crash).
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This information is then anlyzed and returned to our operational system to act on the claim:
# MAGIC - Claims images are analyzed with AI to ensure consistency with declaration
# MAGIC - Rule engine review the claims and customer profile, providing recommendation and taking automated actions.

# MAGIC ## Typical Challenges in Claims Processing:
# MAGIC   * Insurance companies have to constantly innovate to beat competition
# MAGIC   * Customer Retention & Loyalty can be a challenge as people are always shopping for more competitive rates leading to churn
# MAGIC   * Fraudulent transactions can erode profit margins 
# MAGIC   * Processing Claims can be very time consuming 
# MAGIC <br>
# MAGIC ### Required Solution: 
# MAGIC How to improve the Claims Management process for <b>faster</b> claims settlement, <b>lower</b> claims processing costs, and <b>quicker</b> identification of possible fraud. <br><b>Smart Claims</b> demonstrates automation of key components of this process on the Lakehouse for higher operational efficiencies & to aid human investigation </b>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### How
# MAGIC   * How to manage operational costs so as to offer lower premiums, be competitive & yet remain profitable?
# MAGIC   * How can customer loyalty & retention be improved to reduce churn?
# MAGIC   * How to improve process efficiencies to reduce the response time to customers on the status/decision on their claims?
# MAGIC   * How can funds and resources be released in a timely manner to deserving parties?
# MAGIC   * How can suspicious activities be flagged for further investigation?
# MAGIC ### Why
# MAGIC   * Faster approvals leads to Better Customer NPS scores and Lower Operating expenses
# MAGIC   * Detecting and preventing fraudulent scenarios leads to a lower Leakage ratio
# MAGIC   * Improving customer satisfaction leads to a Lower Loss ratio
# MAGIC ### What is Claims Automation
# MAGIC   * Automating certain aspects of the claims processing pipeline to reduce dependence on human personnel especially in mundane predictable tasks
# MAGIC   * Augmenting additional info/insights to existing claims data to aid/expedite human investigation, eg. Recommend Next Best Action
# MAGIC   * Providing greater explainability of the sitution/case for better decision making in the human workflow
# MAGIC   * Serving as a sounding board to avoid human error/bias as well as providing an audit trail for personel in Claims Roles

# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our claims analysis requires huge volumes of data of all types - structured/semi/unstructured - coming at different velocities. For eg. telematic data from a vehicle from an app is both high volume & high velocity and mostly structured.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC First, we need to ingest and transform claim, policy, party, and accident data sources to build our database.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md  
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Open the [Delta Live Table SQL Pipeline notebook]($./01-Data-Ingestion/01.1-DLT-Ingest-Policy-Claims). 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This will create a <a dbdemos-pipeline-id="dlt-fsi-smart-claims" href="#joblist/pipelines/bf6b21bb-ff10-480c-bdae-c8c91c76d065" target="_blank">DLT Pipeline</a> running in batch or streaming.

# MAGIC ### Security and Governance with Unity Catalog
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Unity Catalog provides the centralized governance of <b> all data and AI assets </b> on Databricks. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC It not only provides for easy data discovery but also protects data from unauthorized access through ACLS at the table, row, and column level ensuring PII data remains masked even for the claims investigation officer. <br/>
# MAGIC In addition, it provides audit trails of who accessed what data which is critical in regulated industries. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our data ingested, we can simply grant access to our Data Scientist team for them to explore the data and start building models.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC The Lakehouse offers a wide range of modeling capabilities to cater to ML practitioners' needs- from autoML to classical, deep learning, and Gen AI models, including the end-to-end lifecycle management of these models as well.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Now that our data is ready and secured, let's create a model to predict the severity of the damage to the vehicle from the accident data. The intent here is to assess if the reported severity matches the actual damage and we can use computer vision algorithms to aid in the automation of this task.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC Open the [02.1-Model-Training]($./02-Data-Science-ML/02.1-Model-Training) notebook to start training a model to recognize claims severity from images.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our accident severity level is automatically detected as part of our ingestion pipeline, we can apply dynamic rules to start a first level of classification and Analysis. Jump to [02.3-Dynamic-Rule-Engine]($./02-Data-Science-ML/02.3-Dynamic-Rule-Engine) for more details.
