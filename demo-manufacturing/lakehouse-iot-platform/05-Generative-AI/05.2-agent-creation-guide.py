# MAGIC # üöÄ Deploying Your AI Functions with Databricks AI Agents
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this notebook, you'll learn how to take the functions you defined in your previous Databricks notebook and integrate them into a **Databricks AI Agent**. This will allow you to use them in applications, the Databricks Playground, or other contexts where AI-driven functionality is needed.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We'll walk through the process step by step, with **GIFs** to guide you along the way. By the end, you'll have a working AI Agent powered by your own functions, ready to deploy and use. Let's get started!

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Quick Setup Tips
# MAGIC * üìå Duplicate this browser window
# MAGIC * üí° Keep this guide open for reference
# MAGIC * üéØ Arrange windows side-by-side
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This simple preparation will make your journey much smoother! üòé

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Location Guide
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Find the **Playground** under the **Machine Learning** section in your Databricks Workspace's left sidebar.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Location Guide
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Your functions are organized in Unity Catalog using this structure:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Example Path:
# MAGIC `my_catalog.my_schema.my_awesome_function`
# MAGIC
# MAGIC üí° Note: Replace the example names with your actual catalog and schema names.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Make sure to add the vector index turbine_maintenance_guide_vs_index directly and not use the hosted functions tab
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://docs.databricks.com/aws/en/assets/images/playground-add-vector-search-tool-54316b8fd82e5ae1f64c8c5b16212a58.png" style="float: right; width: 600px; margin-left: 10px">

# MAGIC ### Make sure you add a proper system prompt so that your agent knows how to use the AI function you provided.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Here is an example:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC Act as an assistant for wind turbine maintenance technicians.
# MAGIC     These are the tools you can use to answer questions:
# MAGIC       - turbine_maintenance_predictor: takes as input sensor_readings and predicts whether or not a turbine is at risk of failure. 
# MAGIC         Use turbine_specifications_retriever to get the current status.
# MAGIC       - turbine_maintenance_guide_retriever: send the question, model and error code to get the relevant turbine part maintenance guide to assist the user with maintenance operation.
# MAGIC       - turbine_specifications_retriever: takes turbine_id as input and retrieves turbine specifications.
# MAGIC     
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If a user gives you a turbine ID, first look up that turbine's information with turbine_specifications_retriever. 
# MAGIC If a user asks for recommendations on how to do maintenance on a turbine, use the maintenance guide to search how to maintain the parts and provide guidance on the steps required to fix the turbines
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### You can now ask questions such as:
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Get met the status of the wind turnbine ID '25b2116a-ae6c-ff55-ce0c-3f08e12656f1'? Is it at risk of failure?
# MAGIC * The VibeGuard TVS-950 is giving me an error code TVS-001. What does it means?

# MAGIC </div>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Export Checklist
# MAGIC * ‚úÖ Verify all of the functions from 05.1-Agent-Functions-Creation (_or more that you may have added_) are **selected tools** in the Playground.
# MAGIC * ‚úÖ Click the "_Export_" button in the Playground
# MAGIC * ‚úÖ Save the exported notebooks to this directory (**"YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH/05-Generative-AI/"**)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## üöÄ Step 5: Deploy Your AI Agent
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Final Steps
# MAGIC 1. Navigate to where your exported "driver" notebook is located.
# MAGIC 2. Follow that notebook's documentation and guide.
# MAGIC 3. Close this notebook. You may proceeed to using the "driver" and "agent" notebooks from here. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Important for the Vector Index
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Within the VectorSearchRetrieverTool in your driver notebook add the content you would normally add to a function like tool_name, tool_description and num_results before executing it.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ```
# MAGIC VectorSearchRetrieverTool(
# MAGIC         index_name=<<Your Index e.g. turbine_maintenance_guide_vs_index>>,
# MAGIC         tool_name="turbine_maintenance_guide_retriever",
# MAGIC         tool_description="Returns one mantainance report based on asked question",
# MAGIC         num_results=1
# MAGIC     )
# MAGIC ```

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Congratulations! You have deployed your first Agent System for Prescriptive Maintenance! 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC We have seen how Databricks Mosaic AI provides all the capabilities needed to move these components to production quickly and cost-effectively, while maintaining complete control and governance:
# MAGIC - Simplifying model deployment by creating an API endpoint.
# MAGIC - Scaling similarity search against unstructured data to support billions of embeddings.
# MAGIC - Leveraging structured data by serving features on an endpoint.
# MAGIC - Deploying open models, while keeping the flexibility to swap them as needed.
# MAGIC - Integrating everything using popular orchestration frameworks like Langchain or LlamaIndex.
# MAGIC - Managing AI tools using Unity Catalog for security and re-use.
# MAGIC - Composing the AI system with the Mosaic AI Agent Framework.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### What's next after you finish this notebook?
# MAGIC * üîç **Agent Evaluation:** Test and validate performance
# MAGIC * üåü **Agent Deployment:** Place your agent in a Databricks App or in the Playground for others to use!
# MAGIC * ‚öôÔ∏è **Additional Agent Features:** _and much more!_
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Potential next steps four our agent system:
# MAGIC Enhance the Agent System by incorporating:
# MAGIC - **Automated Technician Assignment for Work Orders:** Automatically asign maintenance work orders to technicians based on availability, distance to turbines and skill set.
# MAGIC - **Automated Field Service Route Optimization:** optimizes field service routes for technicians to execute the maintenance work orders based on priority levels of work orders, travel time and real-time traffic conditions.
