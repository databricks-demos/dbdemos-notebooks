# MAGIC # Churn Prediction - Single click deployment with AutoML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's see how we can now leverage the C360 data to build a model predicting and explaining customer Churn.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our first step as Data Scientist is to analyze and build the features we'll use to train our model.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The users table enriched with churn data has been saved within our Delta Live Table pipeline. All we have to do is read this information, analyze it and start an Auto-ML run.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %pip install databricks-sdk==0.36.0 mlflow==2.19.0 databricks-feature-store==0.17.0

# MAGIC ## Data exploration and analysis
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Let's review our dataset and start analyze the data we have to predict our churn

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Read our churn gold table
# Read our churn_features table
churn_dataset = spark.table("churn_features")
display(churn_dataset)

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Data Exploration and analysis
import seaborn as sns
g = sns.PairGrid(churn_dataset.sample(0.01).toPandas()[['age_group','total_amount','order_count']], diag_sharey=False)
g.map_lower(sns.kdeplot)
g.map_diag(sns.kdeplot, lw=3)
g.map_upper(sns.regplot)

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Further data analysis and preparation using pandas API
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Because our Data Scientist team is familiar with Pandas, we'll use `pandas on spark` to scale `pandas` code. The Pandas instructions will be converted in the spark engine under the hood and distributed at scale.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Typicaly Data Science project would involve more advanced preparation and likely require extra data prep step, including more complex feature preparation. We'll keep it simple for this demo.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC *Note: Starting from `spark 3.2`, koalas is builtin and we can get an Pandas Dataframe using `pandas_api()`.*

# COMMAND ----------

# DBTITLE 1,Custom pandas transformation / code on top of your entire dataset
# Convert to koalas
dataset = churn_dataset.pandas_api()
dataset.describe()  
# Drop columns we don't want to use in our model
dataset = dataset.drop(columns=['address', 'email', 'firstname', 'lastname', 'creation_date', 'last_activity_date', 'last_event'])
# Drop missing values
dataset = dataset.dropna()

# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img src="https://github.com/QuentinAmbard/databricks-demo/raw/main/product_demos/mlops-end2end-flow-feature-store.png" style="float:right" width="500" />
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Once our features are ready, we'll save them in Databricks Feature Store. Under the hood, features store are backed by a Delta Lake table.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This will allow discoverability and reusability of our feature accross our organization, increasing team efficiency.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Feature store will bring traceability and governance in our deployment, knowing which model is dependent of which set of features. It also simplify realtime serving.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Make sure you're using the "Machine Learning" menu to have access to your feature store using the UI.

# COMMAND ----------

from databricks.feature_store import FeatureStoreClient

fs = FeatureStoreClient()

try:
  #drop table if exists
  fs.drop_table(f'{catalog}.{db}.churn_user_features')
except:
  pass
#Note: You might need to delete the FS table using the UI

  primary_keys='user_id',
  schema=dataset.spark.schema(),
  description='These features are derived from the churn_bronze_customers table in the lakehouse.  We created dummy variables for the categorical columns, cleaned up their names, and added a boolean flag for whether the customer churned or not.  No aggregations were performed.'
)

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ## Accelerating Churn model creation using MLFlow and Databricks Auto-ML
# MAGIC
# MAGIC MLflow is an open source project allowing model tracking, packaging and deployment. Everytime your datascientist team work on a model, Databricks will track all the parameter and data used and will save it. This ensure ML traceability and reproductibility, making it easy to know which model was build using which parameters/data.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### A glass-box solution that empowers data teams without taking away control
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While Databricks simplify model deployment and governance (MLOps) with MLFlow, bootstraping new ML projects can still be long and inefficient. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Instead of creating the same boilerplate for each new project, Databricks Auto-ML can automatically generate state of the art models for Classifications, regression, and forecast.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <img width="1000" src="https://github.com/QuentinAmbard/databricks-demo/raw/main/retail/resources/images/auto-ml-full.png"/>
# MAGIC
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Models can be directly deployed, or instead leverage generated notebooks to boostrap projects with best-practices, saving you weeks of efforts.

# MAGIC
# MAGIC ### Using Databricks Auto ML with our Churn dataset
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Auto ML is available in the "Machine Learning" space. All we have to do is start a new Auto-ML experimentation and select the feature table we just created (`churn_features`)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our prediction target is the `churn` column.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Click on Start, and Databricks will do the rest.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC While this is done using the UI, you can also leverage the [python API](https://docs.databricks.com/applications/machine-learning/automl.html#automl-python-api-1)
# MAGIC
# MAGIC <br style="clear: both">

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC AutoML saved our best model in the MLFlow registry. Open the experiment from the AutoML run to explore its artifact and analyze the parameters used, including traceability to the notebook used for its creation.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC If we're ready, we can move this model into Production stage in a click, or using the API.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md 
# MAGIC ### The model generated by AutoML is ready to be used in our DLT pipeline to detect customers about to churn.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Our Data Engineer can now easily retrive the model `dbdemos_customer_churn` from our Auto ML run and predict churn within our Delta Live Table Pipeline.<br>
# MAGIC Re-open the DLT pipeline to see how this is done.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC #### Track churn impact over the next month and campaign impact
# MAGIC
# MAGIC This churn prediction can be re-used in our dashboard to analyse future churn, take actiond and measure churn reduction. 
# MAGIC
# MAGIC The pipeline created with the Lakehouse will offer a strong ROI: it took us a few hours to setup this pipeline end 2 end and we have potential gain for $129,914 / month!
